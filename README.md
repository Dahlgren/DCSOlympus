### What is this?
DCS: Olympus is a free and open-source mod for DCS that enables dynamic real-time control through a map interface. The user is able to spawn units/groups, deploy a variety of effects such as smoke, flares, or explosions, and waypoints/tasks can be given to AI units in real-time in a way similar to a classic RTS game. 

Additionally Olympus is able to run several effects and unit behaviours beyond the core DCS offerings. This includes such things as napalm and white phosphosous explosions, or setting up AA units to fire at players and miss, and more.

It even includes Red and Blue modes which limit your view and powers to just seeing what your coalition sees, with a spawning budget you could play against your friends even with no-one in the game piloting, or have a Red commander working against a squadron of blue pilots, and/or a blue commander working with them. 

Even better it requires no client mods be installed if used on a server

The full feature list is simply too long to enumerate in a short summary but needless to say Olympus offers up a lot of unique gameplay that has previously not existed, and enhances many other elements of DCS in exciting ways
